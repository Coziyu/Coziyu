## Hey I'm Nicholas.

I'm learning how to program mainly in C++ and I'm a seasoned spaghetti cooker. 
I'm also currently learning how to properly use CMake, Git and OpenGL so if you are reading this, and you would be so kind, please do hit me up with pointers!  


Oh and I also program in Julia occasionally!
